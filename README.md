irssi-notify
============

This script reads an irssi log file and displays new messages as notifications
on Ubuntu using notify-send.

I hacked it together in a hurry and it's not a very elegant solution nor is it
very configurable, however it does its job well if you're only looking for a
simple method to get notifications from a specific channel, which I in this
case did.
